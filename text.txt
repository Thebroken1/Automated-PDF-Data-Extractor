Our revenue model focuses on advertising revenue from experts. SkillShot will provide a free
service to users, while charging experts for ad placements. Revenue generation will occur
through:
- Advertising Revenue from Experts:
Experts will pay a monthly fee of €93 to promote their services. We project onboarding 50
experts in the first 6 months, which will generate €55,800 in annual revenue.
As we grow and attract more experts, we expect to increase the number to 200 experts by
the end of year one, which could generate up to €223,200 annually in ad revenue.
